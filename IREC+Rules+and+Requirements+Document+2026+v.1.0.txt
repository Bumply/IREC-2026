1.0 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This document defines the rules and requirements governing participation in the International
Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC). Additional guidance for collegiate teams entered in the
IREC is contained in the IREC Design, Test, & Evaluation Guide (DTEG), maintained on the
ESRA website. The DTEG provides teams with project development guidance ESRA uses to
promote flight safety. Departures from this guidance may negatively impact an offending team's
score and flight status depending on the degree of severity.
Additional requirements for project deliverables can be found in the Integrated Master Schedule
document, which is available on the ESRA website.
If any IREC team is unclear about competition rules and requirements, the spirit and intent of the
rules or has a situation not specifically addressed by this document, they should contact ESRA via
the Experimental Sounding Rocket Association Discord Server.

2.0 INTERNATIONAL ROCKET ENGINEERING COMPETITION OVERVIEW
Student teams competing in the IREC must design, build, and launch a rocket carrying a payload
of no less than 4.4 lbs. to a target apogee of either 10,000 ft, or 30,000 ft, or 45,000 ft above ground
level (AGL). Team Projects will be divided into one of the following nine categories based on the
type of project attempted. Teams are permitted to switch categories/ downgrade from their original
accepted category if required, teams are not allowed to upgrade categories. Teams shall switch
categories prior to submitting their final Project Technical Report. The team must email prior to
the submission of the Project Technical Report an e-mail entitled "TEAM <Your Team ID>
FORMALLY SWITCHES CATEGORIES from Competition Year IREC" to
general.info@esrarocket.org and must receive approval to this request . For example, a team
assigned the Team ID "100" would switch categories from the 2026 IREC by sending an e-mail
entitled "TEAM 100 FORMALLY SWITCHES CATEGORIES FROM THE 2026 IREC".
● 10,000 ft AGL apogee with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solid or hybrid rocket
propulsion system
● 30,000 ft AGL apogee with COTS solid or hybrid propulsion system
● 10,000 ft AGL apogee with student-researched and developed (SRAD) solid rocket
propulsion system.
● 30,000 ft AGL apogee with SRAD solid rocket propulsion system
● 10,000 ft AGL apogee with SRAD hybrid or liquid rocket propulsion system
● 30, 000 ft AGL apogee with SRAD hybrid or liquid rocket propulsion system
● 30,000 ft AGL apogee Two Stage any propulsion type
● 45,000 ft AGL apogee Two Stage any propulsion type
● Non-competing demonstration flights (including high altitude demo flights (50k ft+)
2.1 GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR DESIGN AND FLIGHT OPERATIONS
SRAD propulsion systems are defined as those designed by and manufactured by students. Under
no circumstances are the SRAD propellant components/energetic materials to be manufactured by
a third party. This includes solid propellant grains.
Multistage launch vehicles and all chemical propulsion disciplines (solid, liquid, and hybrid) are
allowed.
Note that all propellants used must be non-toxic. Ammonium perchlorate composite propellant
(APCP), potassium nitrate and sugar (aka "rocket candy"), nitrous oxide, liquid oxygen (LOX),
hydrogen peroxide, kerosene, propane, and similar substances, are all considered non-toxic. Toxic
propellants are defined as those requiring breathing apparatus, special storage and transport
infrastructure, extensive personal protective equipment, etc. (e.g., Hydrazine and N2O4).
ESRA uses the DTEG to define and promote flight safety. The IREC utilizes national standards
including NFPA 1127, FAA and other regulatory organizations. The requirements are specifically

listed in the DTEG. Departures from the DTEG may negatively impact an offending team’s score
and flight status, depending on the degree of severity.
Competition Officials will evaluate competitors for Awards within each competition category
based on the quality of required project documentation, a Poster Session held during the IREC
Conference, the quality of their system’s overall design and construction, and finally the program’s
overall operational efficiency and performance demonstrated at the IREC. Furthermore,
Competition Officials will select no less than 24 teams to present a particular aspect of their work
in a Podium Session held during the IREC Conference. These teams are eligible to receive certain
Technical Achievement Awards.
2.2 TEAM COMPOSITION AND ELIGIBILITY
2.2.1 STUDENT TEAM MEMBERS
IREC Teams shall consist of members who were matriculated undergraduate or graduate students
(i.e., Masters or Doctoral students) during the previous academic year (e.g., former students who
graduated shortly before the competition remain eligible). Two teams may be accepted from the
same academic institution if they utilize two different forms of propulsion (e.g. COTS and SRAD
Hybrid), including the non-competing demonstration category. A team who wishes to enter into
high altitude demo flights may have the same form of propulsion as their competing team.
There is no limit on the overall number of students per team, or the number of graduate students
per team. Individual students may only compete on a single team.
2.2.2 TEAM ORGANIZATION AND SUBMISSION LIMITATIONS
Two teams may be accepted from the same academic institution if they are utilizing two different
forms of propulsion (e.g. COTS and SRAD Hybrid). Furthermore, no project may be entered in
more than one category at the IREC. However, as previously noted, teams are permitted to
downgrade to 10k COTS, if necessary, before submitting their final Project Technical Report. The
event organizers will track and evaluate each team separately. Each team has to be independent,
no shared team members from each accepted team is allowed.
Acceptance into the International Rocket Engineering Competition is highly selective. Teams are
strongly encouraged to participate with local rocketry programs to gain high power rocketry flight
experience prior to the competition launch days. Teams with SRAD, hybrid, or liquid projects
should have experience relevant to their project (ex: minimum of a static, full-scale hot fire).
Teams are also encouraged to have an experienced mentor and flyer of record. Competition
officials will evaluate the overall quality of the team’s application, relevant experience team,
outreach efforts, and previous competition experience to determine which teams will be accepted.
2.2.3 TEAM COMPOSITION AND MULTI-SCHOOL TEAMS
In general, the intent is that competing teams should represent one institution. However, when
there are not enough capable students at a given institution to form a team, a team can be formed

using students from more than one institution. The team must email general.info@esrarocket.org
and must receive approval to this request prior to formation of the multi-school team is allowed to
compete. If an institution fields a team, students from that institution cannot join another team.
Teams will document their institutional affiliation(s) via the School Participation Letter(s)
specified in 2.6.6.1
2.3 PAYLOAD
2.3.1 PAYLOAD MASS
The launch vehicle shall carry no less than 4.4 lbs. of payload. Payload is defined as being
replaceable with ballast of the same mass, with no change to the launch vehicle’s trajectory in
reaching the target apogee, or its successful recovery. This payload may be assumed present when
calculating the launch vehicle's stability. There is no requirement for launch vehicles to be stable
without the required payload mass on board.
Competition officials will “weigh” the launch vehicle’s payload(s) at the International Rocket
Engineering Competition with a scale they provide. Understanding there may be discrepancies
between a team’s scale and the official one used for weigh-in, competition officials will accept
payload weigh-ins as much as 5% (~0.2 lb.) less than the specified minimum without penalty. For
example, competition officials will not penalize a team whose payload measured 4.4 lbs. on the
team’s scale but 4.2 lbs. on the officials’ scale. Any weight greater than the specified minimum is
acceptable. Vehicle payloads must be mechanically robust and not be damaged or shifted in any
phase of flight or during recovery. Poorly designed payload may cause a loss of payload score at
judge’s discretion as described in section 2.8.1.6.
2.3.2 INDEPENDENT PAYLOAD FUNCTIONALITY
Although non-functional "boiler-plate" payloads are permitted, teams are highly encouraged to
launch creative scientific experiments and technology demonstrations. However, launch vehicles
shall be designed to deliver the payload to the target apogee and recover themselves independent
of any active or passive payload function(s). For example, an active launch vehicle stability
augmentation system is a launch vehicle subsystem – not a payload. Such launch vehicle
subsystems will contribute to competition officials’ overall evaluation of a project and may be
submitted to the IREC Conference Podium Session described in Section 2.6.4 of this document,
but they are not payloads.
Scientific experiments and technology demonstration payloads entered in the IREC may be
evaluated for awards. Representatives from the Space Dynamics Laboratory (SDL) host the SDL
Payload Challenge – an Intercollegiate Payload Engineering Competition hosted at International
Rocket Engineering Competition. Teams wishing to enter their payload(s) into the SDL Payload
Challenge should consult the SDL Payload Challenge Page on the ESRA website.
(https://www.esrarocket.org/sdl-payload-challenge).

2.3.3 PAYLOAD LOCATION AND INTERFACE
Neither the payload's location in the launch vehicle of a single stage category nor is its method of
integration and removal specified; however, for a two-stage category the payload must be in the
sustainer. Competition officials will weigh payload(s) independent of all launch vehicle associated
systems prior to flight; therefore, the payload(s) submitted for weigh-in shall not be inextricably
connected to other launch vehicle associated components (e.g., the launch vehicle's recovery
system, internal structure, or airframe) while being weighed. If the payload's design prevents it
from being weighed completely independent of the launch vehicle or interface with the launch
vehicle (e.g., an adapter to mate the payload to the rocket), competition officials will impose a
point penalty on the team in accordance with Section 2.8.1.6 of this document. Judges will also
verify the payload’s capability to withstand launch and recovery loads. Teams with payloads that
are not properly secured may shift in flight and will be denied launch access until the payload is
properly secured. All payloads must be weighed, measured, and checked in by Space Dynamics
Laboratory (SDL) before launch no matter the functionality of the payload or whether or not the
payload is entered into the SDL Payload Challenge.
2.3.4 RESTRICTED PAYLOAD MATERIALS
Payloads shall not contain significant quantities of lead or other heavy metals. Additionally,
payload shall not contain any hazardous materials that impact the health and safety of team
members, staff, the general public, the convention center, or the launch site itself. Similarly, any
use of radioactive materials shall be permitted only if operationally necessary and approved by
competition officials. If approved, any such materials shall be fully encapsulated and are limited
to 1 µC or less of activity. Finally, payloads shall not contain any live, vertebrate animals.
Approvals shall be gained prior to attending the event and will not be granted on site. If teams have
any questions about payload materials, they should seek clarification on the ESRA discord or via
e-mail as early as possible.
2.3.5 PAYLOAD FORM FACTOR
The following sections concern the required shape and dimensions of payload(s) submitted for
weigh-in. These requirements are different if the payload is a non-functional “boiler-plate” (aka
mass emulator) or if it is a functional scientific experiment/technology demonstration (i.e., those
entered in the SDL Payload Challenge). Section 2.3.5.1 defines the requirements for nonfunctional payloads. Section 2.3.5.2 defines the requirements for functional payloads. ESRA’s
“Payload Cube Unit” is defined in Table 1 below. This definition applies throughout this document.
The definition is inspired by the CubeSat standard but is not identical to it. No other CubeSat factors
outside Table 1 will be considered for Payload Bonus Points.

International Rocket Engineering Competition Rules & Requirements Effective Date: 10/05/2025
Page 12 of 43

Verify this is the correct version before use.
Table 1: ESRA Payload Form Factor Definitions
Note: To be compliant with Payload Cube Unit dimensions, the payload outer mold line must be
completely inscribed by a rectangle at the minimum tolerance condition and circumscribed by a
rectangle at the maximum tolerance condition. For example, a 100 mm diameter rod is not
compliant, but a 100 mm cube is.
2.3.5.1 NON-FUNCTIONAL PAYLOAD
Any launch vehicle carrying strictly non-functional payload mass (ie. ballast weight), as it’s
payload shall do so in the form of a 3U “Payload Cube Unit”, listed in table 1 of this document.
2.3.5.2 SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT PAYLOAD
Any functional scientific experiment or technology demonstration payload and its associated
structure (i.e. those entered in the SDL Payload Challenge) may be constructed in any form factor,
provided the experiment/technology and its associated structure remain in compliance with
Sections 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3, and 2.3.4 of this document. With special regard to compliance with
Section 2.3.1, the required minimum payload mass should be achieved primarily by the
experiment(s)/technology and associated support structure. The payload design may incorporate
up to 1.15 lbs. of non-functional “boiler-plate” mass to meet the required mass minimum while
remaining exempt from Section 2.3.5.1 above. This non-functional “boiler-plate mass must be
weighed separately from the rest of the payload to ensure it does not exceed the allowed mass as
specified above. Competition officials may impose a point penalty on any team believed to be
violating the spirit and intent of this rule in accordance with Section 2.8.1.6 of this document.
Finally, despite this exemption, ESRA highly encourages teams to adopt the Payload Cube Unit
physical standard for their payload(s) whenever possible – either as the payload structure itself, or
as an adapter which the payload is mated to prior to the combined assembly’s integration with the
launch vehicle (such an adapter could be included in the official payload mass). To promote this

encouragement, teams whose functional payloads do adopt the Payload Cube Unit physical
standard will be awarded bonus points in the IREC in accordance with Section 2.8.1.7. To meet
this requirement, a payload will have to fit completely in a Payload Cube Unit dispenser with
nothing protruding or physically connecting outside as listed in the Table 1 of Section 2.3.5.
2.3.5.3 DEPLOYABLE PAYLOADS
Deployable Payloads that eject a payload out during the flight and or eject once they have landed
with the rest of the rocket are allowed. GPS for tracking these deployable payloads is required by
the DTEG .Teams are advised to evaluate their designs as deployable payloads will bring a
significant project risk and high level of scrutiny to that team’s entry. Deployable UAS payloads
are prohibited.
2.3.5.4 NON-COMPETITING DEMONSTRATION FLIGHTS
Any team entering a rocket as a high-altitude demonstration flight (that may require a Class 3
waiver) shall coordinate with ESRA officials to ensure the team secures the needed airspace
permissions. Teams who enter into the demonstration flight category are not eligible for podium
sessions, category, or technical awards. They are still required to submit progress updates,
technical report, school participation letter and insurance. Teams who submit the final technical
report and wish to change their category can only switch to the non-competing demonstration
category via ESRA permission.
2.4 GPS ROCKET TRACKING
All IREC launch vehicles shall carry a Global Position System (GPS) tracking system to expedite
rocket recovery. GPS Tracking requirements are described in detail within the IREC Design, Test,
and Evaluation Guide (DTEG), maintained on the ESRA website:
(https://www.esrarocket.org/documents-and-forms).
2.5 OFFICIAL ALTITUDE LOGGING
Launch vehicles shall carry a COTS barometric pressure altimeter with on-board data storage,
which will provide an official log of apogee for scoring. This may either be a standalone COTS
product, or a feature of a COTS flight computer also used for launch vehicle recovery system
deployment.
While the on-board log is considered the primary data source for official altitude reporting,
telemetry – if implemented – may be accepted under certain circumstances defined in Section
2.8.1.4 of this document. If implemented, this telemetry data shall originate from the same sensor
source as the official on-board data log.
All rocket recovery teams must report directly to the Postflight Inspection tent once they return
with their rocket, along with any required equipment (e.g., laptop, cables and tools) to read the
altimeter data to the Postflight Inspection team. The Postflight Inspection team will first listen to
the beeps from the altimeter and/or then verify using the altimeter readout of the flight data. The

first COTS altimeter that students choose to connect to or listen to the beeps will be the official
altitude data. The only exception is if the altimeter is damaged and data is unreadable. Altitude
data is critical to providing a final score for your team. Teams will be required to open up/ take
apart the electronics bays during this review. Teams are expected to come prepared with all the
necessary tools and equipment for this and should expect not to have access to power or internet.
Teams will have 45 minutes to complete this review with a Post Flight Data Inspection Judge.
Once this time passes teams will incur a 20-point penalty for unpreparedness and holding up the
line . The cutoff check-in time for teams with their rocket at Postflight Data Inspection during
Wednesday-Friday is 20:00 local time. For Saturday, the cutoff check-in time for this inspection
is 09:00 local time. Failure to report directly for the Postflight Inspection could cause your team
to be penalized up to and including a zero-flight altitude score. Any team that has not received a
recovery score by 10 am on Saturday will receive a zero-flight altitude score, no matter the
circumstances. DO NOT WAIT UNIT THE FINAL DAY TO LAUNCH OR RECOVER!
2.6 PROJECT DELIVERABLES
The following sections define the deliverable materials (e.g., paperwork and presentation
materials) competition officials require from teams competing in the IREC – including as
appropriate each deliverable's format and minimum expected content. All deliverables will be
submitted to ESRA per the instructions provided to the teams. Each relevant deliverable
description will facilitate submission of that deliverable or will be communicated to teams as is
determined by ESRA. Late submissions will disqualify the team from the competition. Incomplete,
or incorrect submissions, including progress updates, will result in a loss of points in accordance
with paragraph 2.8.1.1. Submissions are incorrect if data is incorrect, entered the wrong fields or
not entered in accordance with submission guidance. This too includes entering units when only
numerical data is requested.
The scheduled due dates of all required deliverables are recorded in the Integrated Master
Schedule Document, maintained on the ESRA website (https://www.esrarocket.org/documentsand-forms).
2.6.1 ENTRY FORM AND PROGRESS UPDATES
Each team shall inform ESRA of their desire to compete in the IREC by registering as a new
team on the Experimental Sounding Rocket Association website: (esrarocket.org). Teams shall
submit progress updates via the esrarocket.org site on three specific occasions prior to the
competition. The third progress will include a live video review to be held online. These progress
updates will record progression in the project's technical characteristics during development.
Competition officials understand not all technical details will be known until later in the design
process. Therefore, the Entry Form and all subsequent Progress Updates prior to the final
submission will be evaluated based only on their timeliness and completeness. Timeliness and
completeness are defined as follows:

The electronic version is the official, approved document.
Verify this is the correct version before use.
Total completeness of the entry form and subsequent updates is always required. Reasonable
engineering estimates and approximations are expected during the application process but will be
subject to progressive additional scrutiny in the subsequent Progress Updates. Teams should
briefly mention their ongoing discussions and analysis in the comment fields for any numerical
submissions that are known to be unreasonable or remain undecided. Teams may also respond to
undecided criteria by demonstrating their understanding of any applicable event guidance or best
practice governing the particular detail. In general, ESRA expects technical information to change,
but information must always be provided. Only teams whose application meets this standard will
be evaluated for entry into the competition. Accepted teams will be announced per the Master
Schedule and each accepted team will receive a Team ID. Once assigned, any correspondence
between a team and ESRA must contain that team's ID number to enable a timely and accurate
response. All submissions for the following progress updates shall follow the naming
convention TeamID_Formal University Name_Purpose. Example: Team100_ESRA
University_ Progress Report 1. Any other naming convention used will incur a 5-point
deduction from the corresponding submission.
2.6.1.1 ONLINE PROGRESS UPDATE AND SAFETY REVIEW
For the 3rd progress update, teams will submit information on esrarocket.org and discuss their
rocket in an online session with safety reviewers. Specific instructions will be forthcoming, but
teams should expect to create a short slide presentation reviewing their current progress and to
discuss issues previously raised by the safety reviewers. Teams shall have their rocket available
for review (realizing that the build should be mostly complete by this point in the competition).
Teams are responsible for coordinating and providing a meeting link to this online safety
review with their established Flight Safety Reviewer(s) (as they have been providing
feedback to teams in Progress Report 1 &2) , Flyer of Record and Mentor all must be invited
and present. Teams are responsible for recording this safety review and sending it to ESRA
to be uploaded onto ESRA’s social media platforms.
Note: Teams who have significant production work remaining by the 3rd progress update may be
disqualified.
2.6.1.2 INITIAL SAFETY REVIEWS
Each progress update will be reviewed for safety, DTEG, and rules compliance. Safety reviewers
will contact teams if necessary to resolve any issues or questions. Teams that are unable to
satisfactorily resolve safety-related issues may be disqualified.
Note: these online safety reviews are not a substitute for the “hands-on” safety review and RSO
process conducted during the actual competition.

and graphics. For SRAD and Hybrid/Liquid teams, the main body of the technical report is limited
to 35 pages, inclusive of all tables and graphics. Appendices may be of any length.
In accordance with the IMS dates, teams shall submit a single digital PDF copy of their Project
Technical Report. Technical reports exceeding 50 Megabytes in size may need to be uploaded to
a cloud server if the permissions allow the judges unrestricted access to the document. Teams shall
submit their Project Technical reports using the esrarocket.org website
(esrarocket.org). Teams should bring a limited number of hard copies to the International Rocket
Engineering Competition so members of the judging panel and other competition officials may
consult the contents at will during interactions with the team.
The Project Technical Report's main title page is left to the team's discretion, however; the paper
shall be subtitled “Team <Your Team ID> Project Technical Report to the <Year> IREC". For
example, a team assigned the Team ID "100", competing in the 2026 IREC, would subtitle their
Project Technical Report "Team 100 Project Technical Report to the 2026 IREC".

The report shall contain an introduction. This introduction is limited to two pages and shall address
the following topics:
1. Category in which the team is competing
2. Unique design characteristics of launch vehicle
3. Payload mission (even if it is only dead weight)
4. High-level project or program goals and objectives (this can be anything from “this is our
first-year competing, so a nominal flight is the goal,” to “fix what went wrong last year”
to, for example, developing active apogee control)
5. Overview of the academic program (is this an extracurricular activity or part of a formal
academic effort with credit given, etc.)
6. Overview of contributors to the project outside the team and academic advisor (this
would include university and commercial facilities used for construction and testing, and
funding sources)
7. The team structure presented as an organization chart (if the titles or position names are
self-explanatory, no further description is needed)
8. Overview of the team management strategies
9. How the Project Technical Report was prepared (i.e., did one person do all the writing or
did section leaders prepare their sections; was a single person in overall charge, how was
the report edited, etc.)
2.6.2.5 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
The Project Technical Report shall contain a System Architecture overview. This section shall
begin with a top-level overview of the integrated system, including a cutaway figure depicting the
fully integrated launch vehicle and its major subsystems – configured for the mission being flown
in the competition. This description shall be followed by the following subsections. Each
subsection shall include detailed descriptions of each subsystem, and reflect the technical analyses
used to support design and manufacturing decisions. The Project Technical Report should not just
discuss what the team did, but the reasoning for the choices. These may include, but are not
limited to, design goals, limitations, potential trade-offs, anticipated component loads along with
safety factors. Technical drawings of these subsystems shall be included in Appendix F.
• Aero-structures Subsystems

2.6.2.6 MISSION CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW
The Project Technical Report shall contain a Mission Concept of Operations (CONOPS)
Overview. This section shall identify the mission phases, include a figure, and describe the nominal
operation of all subsystems during each phase (e.g., a description of what is supposed to be
occurring in each phase, and what subsystem[s] are responsible for accomplishing this).
Furthermore, this section shall define what mission events signify a phase transition has occurred
(e.g., "Ignition" may begin when a FIRE signal is sent to the igniter and conclude when the
propulsion system comes up to chamber pressure. Similarly, "Liftoff" may begin at vehicle first
motion, and conclude when the vehicle is free of the launch rail). Phases and phase transitions are
expected to vary from system to system based on specific design implementations and mission
goals & objectives. No matter how a team defines these mission phases and phase transitions, they
will be used to help organize failure modes identified in a Risk Assessment Appendix – described
in Section 2.6.2.9 of this document.
2.6.2.7 CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
The Project Technical Report shall contain Conclusions and Lessons Learned. This section shall
include the lessons learned during the design, manufacture, and testing of the project, both from a

coverage does not apply to the student team or the individual students. All student teams are
required to obtain and provide proof of insurance coverage by the third progress report for all
attending members prior to attending the International Rocket Engineering Competition
While some teams may choose to be covered by their college or university, there is one eligible
alternative source of insurance coverage. Insurance Coverage for solid and hybrid propulsion
rocket teams can be provided by Tripoli Rocketry Association (www.tripoli.org) (i.e. 10k/30k/45k
COTS, 10k/30k/45k SRAD solid and hybrid categories). The coverage under Tripoli Launch
Insurance comes at no additional cost (except Tripoli membership fees, see below).
If your team chooses insurance coverage through Tripoli Rocketry Association all team members
present at the International Rocket Engineering Competition will be required to be registered as a
dues paying Lvl 0 Member. Proof of membership will be requested at the registration desk on the
first day of events and should be carried throughout the event in case participants lose their badge.
All teams flying under Tripoli Launch insurance shall comply with the guidance in the DTEG,
section 3.
Liquid category flights are NOT COVERED by Tripoli Launch Insurance. These teams are
required to provide their own insurance coverage and to provide documentation of coverage by
the 3rd progress report. The required documentation is written proof, in English, of comprehensive
general liability insurance, including advertising liability and premises liability, of no less than
$1,000,000 US Dollars. Note: individual, personal, or travel insurance policies do not qualify
under this position. Teams without documented insurance coverage will not be allowed to fly.
ESRA is not responsible for and cannot assist in finding suitable insurance policies.

2.8 AWARDS AND SCORING
2.8.1 CATEGORY PLACE AWARDS
A First Place Award will be granted to the highest scoring, eligible team in each of the eight scored
categories defined in Section 2.0 of this document. A Second Place Award will be granted to the
second highest scoring, eligible team in each scored category. A team is considered eligible for
the place award(s) in its category after launching successfully to its 10,000 ft, or 30,000 ft or,
45,000 ft target altitude – depending on category and recovering successfully. In categories with
sufficient teams competing in the category there will be a Third Place Award given. In the event
no teams meet this definition in a given category, competition officials may issue Category Place
Awards at their discretion based on multiple factors – including points accrued, launches
attempted, and flight performance.
Teams are permitted to switch categories as necessary prior to submitting their final Project
Technical Report. For example, if an SRAD propulsion system project encounters insurmountable
difficulties at any point during the academic year, the student team is free to defer work on the
SRAD system and opt for a near-term COTS solution without dropping out of the competition.
For example, a single team may not compete in two categories in the same year by flying once
using a COTS motor, then again using an SRAD motor. In the event such a possibility exists for

any team, the organizers highly encourage that team to compete in an SRAD rather than a COTS
category. Once a team submits their final technical report the team’s category is locked in, the only
exception is if the team switches to the non-competing demonstration flight category. Teams still
must receive ESRA approval to do this.
Competition officials will award points based on their evaluation of each team’s required
documentation (including the Entry Form, Progress Updates, and Project Technical Report),
design implementation (observed through the team's poster display and a day in the field spent
preparing for launch) and demonstrated flight performance (including reported altitude and
successful recovery).
2.8.1.1 SCORING ENTRY FORM AND PROGRESS UPDATE DELIVERIES
The correct, complete, and timely delivery of a team's Entry Form and subsequent Progress
Updates is awarded as many as 60 points – 6% of 1,000 total points possible. The Entry Form and
subsequent updates are considered correct if they are submitted as specified in Section 2.6.1 of this
Document. They will be considered complete if they are filled out in accordance with the online
form on esrarocket.org. They will be considered timely if they are received by the deadline
specified in the IREC Integrated Master Schedule Document.
The 60 points are divided evenly among the four submissions (i.e. the Entry Form and three
subsequent Project Updates), making each submission worth 15 points. The submission is awarded
these points on a pass/fail basis and must meet all three criteria – correctness, completeness, and
timeliness – in order to “pass.” Teams are highly recommended to submit their reports several days
before the deadline to ensure there are no technical issues. There is no GRACE PERIOD for
submissions, late submissions will disqualify the team from the competition
2.8.1.2 SCORING PROJECT TECHNICAL REPORT
Timely Project Technical Reports will be awarded as many as 200 points – 20% of 1,000 points
possible – for their correctness, completeness, and analysis. Only timely Project Technical Reports
will be evaluated and scored. A Project Technical Report is considered timely if it is received
before the deadline specified in the IREC Integrated Master Schedule Document. Teams are highly
recommended to submit their report several days before the deadline to ensure there are no
technical issues. There is no GRACE PERIOD for submissions. Late submissions will disqualify
the team from the competition. All submissions for the technical report shall follow the naming
convention TeamID_Formal University Name_Purpose. Example: Team 100_ESRA
University_Progress Report 1. Any other naming convention used will incur a 5-point
deduction from the corresponding submission.
Feedback on Technical Reports is not guaranteed. Students are encouraged to ask their judges for
any feedback on improvements during the Convention Days. Judges will not share their final

scores of the technical report at any time during the event. The final technical report score will be
posted in the Final Score Sheet.
Correctness is worth 20% (40 points) of the Project Technical Report's overall point value.
Correctness is defined by its adherence to the format/style guide specified in Section 2.6.2 of this
document and upholding of basic technical editing standards. The report's correctness will be rated
using the Technical Report Rubric in Appendix B.
Completeness is worth 10% (20 points) of the Project Technical Report's overall point value. The
Project Technical Report is considered complete if it contains all minimally required content
defined in Section 2.6.2 of this document. Points for completeness are awarded on a pass/fail basis,
and only minor omissions or ambiguity of required information is tolerated in a passing evaluation.
Analysis is worth 70% (140 points) of the Project Technical Report's overall point value. This
constitutes a structured, qualitative assessment by the evaluating competition officials of the
analytic rigor demonstrated by the team during the iterative down-selection, refinement, and
acceptance of all project aspects. The report's analysis will be rated using the Technical Report
Rubric in Appendix B. Teams should note this score may be amended at the IREC itself, based on
the evaluators’ assessment of the team’s conceptual understanding during any interactions.
2.8.1.3 SCORING DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
Teams will be awarded as many as 240 points – 24% of 1,000 points possible – for the overall
design quality, strategic design decisions, and build quality exhibited by their work. Competition
officials will evaluate these criteria through interactions with the teams and their systems,
occurring throughout the IREC Conference Poster Session and all during the following day – spent
making launch preparations in the field.
Design quality is worth 50% (120 points) of the overall value assigned to Design and
Implementation. This constitutes a structured, qualitative assessment by the competition officials
of the team's relative competency in the physical principles governing their design (e.g., Did the
team demonstrate they know what they're doing by designing something likely to work with a
greater or lesser degree of success – provided it is sufficiently well constructed?). This also
evaluates the team's due diligence in deciding how best to implement their design – in keeping
with a strategic vision they can articulate clearly. In general, teams should set strategic goals for
their project which extend beyond simply excelling in a particular category. ESRA places special
significance on projects which leverage SRAD in a particular aspect, either to enhance the team’s
understanding of that subject, or to develop technology necessary for achieving a longer-term
performance goal. The project's design quality and strategic design decisions will be rated using
the Design Implementation Rubric in Appendix B.
Build quality is worth 50% (120 points) of the overall value assigned to Design and
Implementation. This constitutes a structured qualitative assessment by the competition officials

of the team's quality with which that design was constructed (e.g., Is the finished product
sufficiently well-constructed to meet the needs of the underlying design and reasonably expected
variation in launch conditions). The project's build quality will be rated using the Design
Implementation Rubric in Appendix B.
2.8.1.4 SCORING FLIGHT PERFORMANCE
Teams will be awarded as many as 500 points – 50% of 1,000 points possible – for their project's
flight performance during launches at the International Rocket Engineering Competition,
demonstrated by altitude achieved relative to the target apogee and successful recovery.
The accuracy of the launch vehicle's actual apogee achieved relative to the target apogee is worth
70% (350 points) of the overall value assigned to flight performance. Precise Trajectory planning
is important. Points will be awarded for apogees within ±30% of the 10,000 ft AGL, or, 30,000 ft
AGL, or 45,000 ft AGL target apogee according to the following formula.
𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑠 = 350 − (
350
0.3 × 𝐴𝑝𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑒𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡) × |𝐴𝑝𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑒𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 − 𝐴𝑝𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑒𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙|
where Apogee Target may equal either 10,000 ft AGL, or 30,000 ft AGL, or 45,000 ft AGL
Teams shall report in person to Post Flight Data Recovery officials immediately after recovery of
their rocket to report the official altitude in accordance with Section 2.5 of this document.
If telemetry data from the COTS altitude logging system is not immediately available, teams may
report the apogee revealed in this telemetry to competition officials if and when a confirmation of
nominal ascent and recovery system deployment events is possible. This information will be used
for scoring only in the event the launch vehicle is not recovered prior to the end of eligible launch
operations on the final scheduled launch day.
The successful recovery of the launch vehicle is worth 30% (150 points) of the overall value
assigned to flight performance. A recovery operation is considered successful if it does not result
in excessive damage to the launch vehicle. Excessive damage is defined as any damage to the point
that, if the system’s intended consumables (e.g., propellants, pressurized gases, energetic devices)
were replenished, it could not be launched again safely. Zippers with a total length greater than
one (1) caliber, crushed body tubes, significant damage to the avionics bay, significant damage to
bulkheads or motor retention hardware, or damage such as crushing or fracturing of the nose cone
all present significant safety concerns and therefore are considered excessive damage. At
competition officials’ discretion, replacement of damaged fins or boat tails specifically designed
for easy, rapid replacement is allowed if such components are on hand and can reasonably be
replaced within 30 minutes. Post Flight Data Recovery officials will visually inspect the launch
vehicle upon its return to the designated basecamp area and award these points on a pass/fail basis.

2.8.1.5 PENALTIES FOR UNSAFE OR UNSPORTSMAN LIKE CONDUCT
Teams will be penalized 20 points off their total earned score for every instance of unsafe or
unsportsmanlike conduct recorded by competition officials (e.g., judges, volunteers, or staff
members). Unsafe conduct includes, but is not limited to, violating the IREC Range Standard
Operating Procedures, failure to use printed checklists during operations, violating ESRA/local
motor vehicle safety rules while on the range, and failure to use appropriate personal protective
equipment. Unsportsmanlike conduct includes, but is not limited to, hostility or extreme frustration
shown towards any IREC Participant, ESRA or other event staff, intentional misrepresentation of
facts to any competition official, and intentional failure to comply with any reasonable instruction
given by a competition official. See Appendix C for Point Violation sheet that will be used.
2.8.1.6 PENALTIES FOR VIOLATING PAYLOAD REQUIREMENTS
Teams will be penalized 100 points off their total earned score for any of the five payload
requirements described in Section 2.2.3 of this document in spirit or intent. These include Mass,
Independent Function, Location & Interface, Restricted Materials, and Form Factor. With regards
to mass, due to the allowance made for differences in measuring devices, teams will not be
permitted to modify their payloads with additional mass to avoid penalty at the event.
2.8.1.7 BONUSES FOR PAYLOAD CUBE UNIT BASED PAYLOADS
Teams whose functional payload(s) qualify for the form factor exemption described in Section
2.3.5.2 of this document, yet still adopt the Payload Cube Unit form factor, will be awarded 50
bonus points in addition to their total earned score. This promotes ESRA’s encouragement that
teams adopt the Payload Cube Unit for their payload(s) whenever possible – either as the payload
structure itself, or as an adapter which the payload is mated to prior to the combined assembly’s
integration with the launch vehicle (such an adapter could be included in the official payload mass).

2.8.1.9 POKER CHIPS
Poker Chips may be received by teams during the week of competition, these chips do not equate
to any points towards the teams overall score, they are on the spot recognition by competition
officials.
2.8.2 JUDGES CHOICE AND OVERALL WINNER AWARD
One team among the First Place Award winners in the eight categories defined in Section 2.0 of
this document will be named the overall winner of the International Rocket Engineering
Competition and will receive their own New Horizons trophy! The recipient of this prestigious
award is determined by quantitative and qualitative assessments of the competition officials made

 Podium Session Rubric
Note: Judges should also review the Project Technical Report for additional detail, but the award must be based
on the material covered in the Podium Session (e.g., if the Podium Session does not cover Modeling &
Simulation, then the team is not eligible for the Hoult Award even if that is covered in the Technical Report).
Note 2: The rubric will be used as a guide to focus the discussion during the Judges’ scoring deliberations and
isn’t the final word.

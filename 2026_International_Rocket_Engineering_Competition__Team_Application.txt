Our team participated in the IREC competition last year. However, during the flight, the motor failed due to a defect caused by the
manufacturer. A crack in the grain led to an unexpected burnout and motor case rupture. Despite this issue, our overall design and
recovery systems performed as expected, and we gained valuable experience in both testing and troubleshooting under real competition
conditions. In addition to IREC, we also participated in TEKNOFEST in our country.

The choice of carbon fiber for the wings and nose cone (excluding the tip) is to ensure high altitude and stability thanks to its exceptional
strength-to-weight ratio. The upper and lower fuselage sections are made of S-Glass Fiberglass for high tensile strength and impact
resistance. The trapezoidal wing set optimizes stability while minimizing drag. The von Kármán nose cone profile was selected for its
superior drag performance, particularly in the transonic and low supersonic ranges. All these choices are aimed at maximum performance
and safety in IREC competition.

The design was sized and optimized with OpenRocket. The von Kármán nose cone and trapezoidal wings were selected to minimize drag
and ensure stability. The M2500T-PS engine was selected because it provided the highest thrust and thrust to reach the 10,000 ft target.
Fin flutter speed was calculated as 506.14~m/s with a NACA TN 4197 (1.5 times the maximum speed, 63.8% safety margin). The minimum
static margin is 1.57 calibers, ensuring stable flight. Structural and CFD analyses will be performed in Ansys, and 6-DOF solutions will be

84. Electronics Description
Describe all the electronics in your rocket. Include COTS and SRAD components and indicate the
role of each component.
Teams are reminded of the requirement that at least one altimeter and one gps in each rocket
section must be a COTS.
For altimeters include manufacturer and model.
For GPS or telemetry, include manufacturer and model.
All teams WILL BE ASSIGNED a gps frequency. US teams will likely be assigned a 70 cm channel
and WILL require a HAM Radio Licence. *
Rocket includes three flight computers and one GPS system. Two of these flight computers are COTS, while the third is an SRAD
system. The primary system selected from our COTS devices is the RRC3 Sport Altimeter produced by Missile Works, which was
successfully tested in our previous year's launch campaign. This altimeter features a 16MHz 16-bit MSP430 series MCU, 8Mbit SST flash
memory, and an MSI NS5697 pressure sensor. The main reasons for choosing this altimeter are its capability to provide highresolution pressure data (due to its 24-bit analog-to-digital converter), its proven reliability from last year's flight. The RRC3 Sport
Altimeter operates with dual deployment, allowing it to open both the drogue and main parachutes in our recovery system.
The secondary system utilized is the EasyMini Altimeter produced by Altus Metrum, which is also a COTS device. The EasyMini
Altimeter contains an ARM Cortex M0 MCU, an NXPLPC11U24 chip, an MS5607 pressure sensor, and 1MB of SPI flash memory. This
system operates in dual deployment mode and serves as a backup to the RRC3, providing an additional layer of safety for the
deployment of the drogue and main parachutes.
As the third system, a custom-designed SRAD flight computer is used, which represents a significant upgrade from our previous year's
logger-only system. Unlike last year's SRAD logger which was used solely for recording flight data, this year's SRAD flight computer
actively participates in the recovery process while also providing comprehensive data logging capabilities. This SRAD flight computer
is built around a 4-layer PCB integrating an STM32F429ZIT6 microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M4F @ 180MHz with hardware FPU), power
regulation circuitry, sensor interfaces, and dual-channel pyrotechnic control. The system includes an MS5611 GY-63 barometric
altimeter for high-precision altitude measurement (±10 cm resolution, 100 Hz sampling), which serves as the altitude source for
apogee detection and main parachute deployment triggering. For inertial measurement, the SRAD computer incorporates an MPU9250 9-DOF IMU for high-G acceleration measurement (±16g range, 1 kHz sampling) during boost phase and trajectory reconstruction,
alongside a GY-BNO080/BNO085 IMU with onboard sensor fusion for attitude determination and redundancy (400 Hz quaternion
output). The SRAD flight computer features dual IRFU120 MOSFET-based pyrotechnic drivers that can independently actuate e-match
igniters for drogue (at apogee) and main parachute (at 500m AGL) deployment, providing an additional layer of redundancy to both
the RRC3 and EasyMini systems. All flight data including altitude, velocity, acceleration, and deployment events are logged at 100 Hz
to a W25Q40CLSNIG flash memory chip (512 KB non-volatile storage) for post-flight analysis. The SRAD system operates with dual
deployment mode, serving as a third independent backup for recovery system deployment.
For GPS tracking and telemetry transmission, a separate system integrates a Ublox NEO-7M GPS module as the primary GPS for
position tracking and landing position determination (2.5m CEP accuracy, 5 Hz update rate), with a Quectel L86-M33 GNSS module
serving as backup GPS with multi-constellation support (GPS/GLONASS/QZSS). A 1575.42MHz 5dBi SMA antenna provides improved
GPS signal reception. The system includes a LoRa E32-433T30D radio module operating on the 433MHz ISM band for long-range GPS
coordinate transmission during flight and recovery, eliminating the need for an HAM license. An HC05 Bluetooth module is included
as a development tool for pre-flight programming and diagnostics (ground use only, not for in-flight telemetry).
The PCB design for the SRAD flight computer will be created using Altium Designer and manufactured by JLCPCB. Our team will
handle the assembly of all components. Power regulation on the SRAD flight computer is achieved through AMS1117-5 voltage
regulators (5V rail for communication modules) and AMS1117-3.3 voltage regulators (3.3V rail for STM32 and sensors), with extensive
filtering provided by 100nF, 1µF, 10µF SMD capacitors and 10µF, 22µF tantalum capacitors. A 16 MHz crystal oscillator with 12pF
capacitors provides the system clock source for the STM32 microcontroller.
Each system has independent power sources. The two COTS flight computers (RRC3 and EasyMini) and the SRAD flight computer
operate using pairs of serially connected Li-Ion batteries, while the GPS/telemetry system is powered by a 3S LiPo battery (11.1V
nominal, 2200 mAh capacity, providing >2 hours operational endurance). All Li-Ion batteries are packaged in metallic cylindrical
enclosures and will be held in commercial battery holders. Battery holders will be placed in a way that prevents acceleration forces
from compressing the springs of battery holders. 22 AWG cables will be used to connect the necessary components. Paired cables will
be in the form of twisted pairs and zip ties will be used where necessary. There is a Schurter rotary switch between each flight
computer, GPS system, and their power sources. All three flight computers (RRC3, EasyMini, and SRAD) activate the recovery system
independently, ensuring triple redundancy in the deployment process.

Our rocket, ANKA, features a dual-deployment recovery system designed to ensure the safe, stable, and fully controlled landing of both
the rocket and its payload after flight. The system consists of two parachutes made from 40D Ripstop Nylon, chosen for its high durability
and tear resistance. The main parachute is red and black for high visibility, while the drogue chute is green and black. Each parachute
includes a central vent hole equal to one-tenth of its diameter to maintain landing stability and reduce oscillations. At apogee, the drogue
chute deploys to stabilize the rocket and reduce descent speed. During the second separation stage, the main chute deploys, further
slowing the rocket to ensure a safe landing in compliance with IREC safety standards. All deployment events are controlled by two
independent altimeters EasyMini and RRC3 Sport each responsible for redundant charge triggering. For the separation mechanism,
specially designed aluminum hot gas generators are used, each with primary and backup igniters. Each separation stage includes two
generators for redundancy if the primary fails, the backup automatically fires. Black powder charges are carefully calculated to ensure
precise and reliable separations. Inside the rocket, four independent gas generators are sealed with aluminum foil to maintain pressure
integrity and consistent burning, guaranteeing redundancy even in case of a single-point failure. The avionics bay includes a pressure
equalization vent to provide accurate barometric measurements at high altitudes. Two 15,000 N-rated, 19 mm-wide Perlon flat shock cords
connect the rocket sections: a 4.5 m cord between the nose and upper body, and a 5.5 m cord between the upper and lower body totaling
10 m, roughly three times the rocket’s length. These cords absorb shock loads during parachute deployment, preventing damage.
The payload is secured inside the lower body via a coupling tube and mounted ring. All structural connections are reinforced with M8
carabiners, M6 swivels, and steel eye bolts. Swivels prevent line twisting during descent, while locking carabiners increase safety by
preventing accidental release. To protect the recovery system from high temperatures and possible ignition effects during black powder
deployment, all parachutes and shock cords are wrapped in fire-resistant protective fabric, which provides excellent heat insulation while
maintaining flexibility. Our recovery system prioritizes safety and reusability, ensuring that every component the main body, avionics bay,
and payload lands safely and can be reused for future launches after optimization through simulations and ground tests.

Our team will compete in the 2026 IREC as a dedicated and technically driven student
rocketry group with over three years of continuous experience in rocket design,
manufacturing, and testing. Last year, our rocket achieved excellent aerodynamic
stability and subsystem integration, but a motor malfunction prevented mission success.
Building on that experience, we are optimizing aerodynamic design, improving
composite manufacturing, and enhancing avionics reliability to ensure a successful
flight. Beyond the technical side, we emphasize teamwork and mentor new members to
strengthen collaboration and engineering skills. In 2026, we aim to compete for the
Barrowman Award and SDL Payload Challenge, while also volunteering in IREC
operations to gain hands-on experience and contribute to the rocketry community.

• The ZENITH Rocket Team was established in 2023 by a group of students from various academic disciplines. Their first
competition was the 2023-2024 Teknofest Rocket Competition in the Medium Altitude category. For this competition,
the team designed and manufactured a rocket with a length of 2800 mm, a dry weight of 19,865 grams, and a
maximum speed of 225 m/s, capable of reaching an altitude of 2606 meters. The Teknofest-approved AeroTech M1850
engine was selected for propulsion. In the Preliminary Design Report phase, the Zenith Rocket Team achieved a ranking
of 39th in Turkey. Following this initial success, the team independently completed the rocket's production and
conducted all the required tests within the specified timeframe. Despite being newly formed and having limited
experience in the production process, the team members meticulously manufactured the rocket’s body, nose cone, and
fins from composite materials, demonstrating remarkable dedication. Furthermore, the rocket was presented at the
MUBAK (Engineering Sciences and Research Student Congress) held at our university and was subsequently featured in
the MUBAK booklet following the event. Throughout the rocket manufacturing process, we gained experience in
various technical, management and production areas. This includes information in technical drawing, tolerance
analysis, preparing CAD and CAM files, and system engineering. We also observed several manufacturing techniques,
such as CNC machining, lathe operations, and mold-making. In composite production, we utilized methods like wet layup and vacuum infusion, achieving high-quality, durable components. Additionally, we acquired valuable knowledge in
PCB design and integration, as well as electronic components assembly methods. We further refined our skills in folding
parachutes and shock cords, understanding the specifications of fasteners, and learning effective techniques for sensor
and communication integrations. Furthermore, we built advanced capabilities in SolidWorks, Ansys Fluent, Ansys
Structural, and OpenRocket, which have been instrumental in our design and simulation processes.
VISA Status for International Teams Numerous international teams each year cannot attend the event in the US due to VISA
request delays. Is your team concerned about securing VISAs to travel to the US? Explain your concerns
• We are optimistic that we will get the VISA without any problems. One of our members has an R B1-B2 America VISA.

Rocket Information - Additional Comments Add additional comments here regarding rocket construction and rationale for
material selection.
(optional)
• For the outer body of our rocket, we selected carbon fiber for the fins and nose cone (excluding the nose tip) due to its
exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, which allows the rocket to withstand extreme forces during launch while
remaining lightweight. This feature enables higher altitudes and greater stability, crucial for competitive performance
at IREC. Carbon fiber is also resistant to bending and flexible, making it ideal for parts that require both strength and
minimal deformation under stress. Additionally, its natural resistance to corrosion and fatigue reduces maintenance
needs and enhances durability compared to traditional aerospace metals, which are valuable under repeated highstress conditions.
For the upper and lower body sections housing our avionics and payload communication modules, we selected
fiberglass with S-glass fibers with plain weave paths due to its high tensile strength and durability. We have also
compared S-Glass with E-Glass, where the difference in tensile strength and modulus of elasticity equates to roughly a
24-35% increase in strength for S-glass, depending on specific manufacturing variations. The higher strength of S-glass,
along with its superior resistance to impact and fatigue, makes it a preferred choice for high-performance applications,
especially in aerospace and defense industries where structural demands are intense.
For the fins of our rocket, we opted for a trapezoidal fin set design, chosen for its aerodynamic properties that
optimize stability and minimize drag. The trapezoidal shape provides a larger surface area at the base, improving
stability while maintaining a streamlined form at the tip to reduce aerodynamic drag. This design choice is crucial
for maintaining control during the high-speed phases of the rocket's flight, where stability is a key factor in
achieving maximum altitude and ensuring safe recovery. Aside from that we have chosen our thickness as 7.5mm
to obtain the required structural strength and flutter conditions of the fins.
We selected the Von Kármán Hack Series nose cone shape due to its superior drag performance in transonic and low
supersonic ranges, according to the comparison of drag characteristics of various nose cone shapes in the transonic to
low-mach regions graph published on rocketry forum. The Von Kármán profile ranks "1" at Mach 1 and maintains low
drag up to Mach 2, making it ideal for our high-speed, altitude-focused rocket which was processed using CNC
machining and G-code export. Additionally, we strategically placed three pressure holes along the rocket body
according to aerodynamic guidelines to ensure accurate altitude and speed measurements during flight. These design
choices optimize stability, reduce drag, and enhance overall performance for IREC competition.
For our rocket's construction, we use a 15cm diameter aluminum tube profile as the base for fiberglass wrapping. The
step-by-step process is as follows:
Firstly, we clean the tube surface so that we can apply epoxy resin to secure the fiberglass. Next, we apply the wax to
an aluminum profile then we cut the fiberglass to sizes, ensuring it covers the length of the tube with tolerance. After
these steps are completed, we wrap fiberglass cloth over the aluminum tube profile for the outer body. Layers are
added as needed to achieve the desired strength and thickness. For the fins, we use a clean glass surface, applying a
release agent to prevent sticking. We then perform the fiberglass layup, layering and applying resin, allowing it to cure
fully. For the nose cone, we create an MDF mold and apply fiberglass layers using the wet-layup technique, carefully
shaping it over the mold with resin. In all the steps we are using necessary vacuuming elements for composite
manufacturing. After all layups are completed, we cure the components in furnace with required time and oven to
ensure durability. After trimming the extras, we finally polish and paint each part to achieve a smooth, aerodynamic
surfaces. The final thickness will reach to 2mm.

• After evaluating the AeroTech M2500T-PS, AeroTech M2400T-PS, AeroTech M1845NT, and AeroTech M1850W motors,
along with the necessary simulations, analyses, and reasons outlined below, we decided to proceed with the AeroTech
M2500T-PS motor. According to values from the Thrustcurve.org, OpenRocket and results from literature research, this
motor provides higher continuous thrust than the others, offering a powerful and stable profile during ascent. Its highthrust-impulse value maximizes the rocket’s flight performance, allowing us to achieve more efficient results. The
AeroTech M2500T-PS also supplies the highest impulse required for the rocket to reach its target altitude compared to
the other motors, with a total impulse of 9573 Ns. The M2500T-PS provides the highest average thrust of 2461 N, which
is higher than the M2400T-PS’s 2400 N, the M1850W’s 1909.6 N, and the M1845NT’s 1875 N. Its diameter of 98 mm
and length of 751 mm fit the other parameters defined in the rocket’s preliminary design perfectly, improving our
overall stability and reaching altitude. The burn time of 3.88 seconds aligns ideally with our preliminary design and
simulation results, playing an important role in achieving our targeted altitude. Additionally, the weight of the AeroTech
M2500T-PS which is 8064g (launch mass) perfectly fitted with our design requirements, contributing to a balanced
flight profile for the rocket.
Taking all parameters into account, we conclude that the AeroTech M2500T-PS is the most suitable motor for our
rocket’s mission and performance objectives, making it the best choice to maximize our flight performance.

Simulation/Analysis Comments* Use this field to provide more detail and methodology used to help justify your analysis.
• In the preliminary design phase, we verified the rocket's dimensions and weight to ensure they met the specified
altitude, speed, and stability requirements through simulations. The initial design was created using OpenRocket
software, and adjustments were made to critical parameters to enhance performance and stability. After completing
the necessary sizing and motor selection processes, we evaluated altitude, speed, acceleration, flight time, and stability
values based on simulation results.
To optimize the rocket's aerodynamic profile, we conducted analyses on various nose cone profiles and fin
configurations. For the nose cone, we evaluated options that would minimize aerodynamic drag at different altitudes
and speeds, ultimately selecting the Von Kármán Hack series profile. This profile offers optimal performance by
reducing drag forces at high speeds while maintaining stability. After finalizing the primary sizing, we analyzed and
compared rocket motors in the propulsion system to select the motor that would help achieve the target altitude. To
ensure flight safety and reach the required fin flutter speed, modifications were made to parameters like the center of
gravity (CG), center of pressure (CP), and fin design. Using the NACA TN 4197 method, we calculated a fin flutter speed
of 506.14 m/s (at least 1.5 times the rocket's maximum speed), with a safety margin of 63.8%. During this analysis,
parameters such as fin angle, thickness, and dimensions were adjusted to optimize altitude, stability, and speed. These
calculations and iterations confirm that the design meets the specified requirements.
By entering the weights and dimensions of all rocket components into the system, we conducted OpenRocket flight
simulations under predetermined flight conditions. Data such as latitude, longitude, altitude, and wind direction were
assumed based on reports from other teams, while wind speeds were tested at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 m/s. The launch rail
length was set to 5.7 meters, and the inclination angle was entered according to specifications. After completing all
sizing and component placements, final simulations were conducted. The vertical position-time graph, which allowed us
to examine values like flight time, altitude, acceleration, and speed, helped us assess the operational concept of the
design. The stability vs. time graph allowed us to observe minimum and maximum stability margin values throughout
the flight. We analyzed the changes in the CG and CP positions during flight and assessed how these changes affected
rocket stability. By observing how the rocket behaved at different altitudes and speeds, we evaluated the impact of CG
and CP shifts on the stability margin. These results guided necessary design measures to maintain stability throughout
the flight, particularly addressing CG shifts caused by fuel consumption. This analysis helped prevent issues such as
over-stability or insufficient stability, ensuring stable flight. Our design achieved a minimum stability margin of 1.57, a
maximum stability margin of 4.26, and a static stability value of 2.94 at 0.3 Mach. These values indicate that the rocket
will fly stably without becoming over-stable. We plan to use CAD software for CG determination, validate the CP value
using the Barrowman method via Excel, and compare it with OpenRocket results. Analytical solutions will be adapted
and executed in Excel and MATLAB.
In the next phase, we will conduct structural and CFD analyses for the nose cone, fins, and rocket body. Forces obtained
from flow analysis will be transferred to structural analyses to examine deformations and von Mises stresses in the
nose cone, fins, and body components. For structural components inside the body, tensile strength and deformation
analyses will be performed, while structural strength tests will be conducted on motor centering rings and motor
retainers. Shear stress analyses will be performed for fasteners, aiming to maintain a safety margin above 1.5 for all
structural analyses. MATLAB Simulink will be used for trajectory and 6-DOF solutions, while structural and flow analyses
will be conducted in Ansys Structural and Ansys Fluent.
For the recovery system, we carried out detailed studies on shock loads at deployment, parachute simulations, and
descent speed calculations to ensure safe and controlled landing. We conducted simulations and calculations to analyze
the high shock loads at parachute deployment, ensuring it open safely without risk of tearing or detachment. Parachute
simulations and analytical calculations were performed to test descent performance at various altitudes and speeds,
allowing us to determine the optimal parachute size for the target descent speed. These calculations minimized the risk
of structural damage by maintaining a safe descent speed, enhancing the safety of the recovery system.

Section 9: Payload Information
NOTE: To compete in the SDL Payload Challenge, you MUST follow the instructions on the Spaceport America Cup Documents and
Forms Page. The information provided here is for ESRA purposes only.
See http://www.soundingrocket.org/sa-cup-documents--forms.html
Payload Description* Please help us to help you by filling this box out as completely as possible. Identify whether the payload is
functional or inert. Include a description of its purpose (if applicable) and its recovery scheme (if applicable). The more
information we have the better we can help you.
• Our mission is to develop a new payload system for finding habitable planets with sustainability, which will be test on
earth, sustainability being the most critical attribute for this purpose. It achieves its objective by mounting four solar
panels onto the payload, each with dimensions of 80x60 mm and specifications of 1.5 V, 0.65 W, and 430 mA. Panels
will be mounted on the side surfaces of the cube and connected to a switch system. These panels safely charge six
batteries, arranged in a three-series, two-parallel connection. Passive BMS is designed to prevent battery overheating
by distributing excess power through resistors in case of overcharging. The charged batteries power our specially
designed SRAD card. Switch system operates in conjunction with altitude data obtained from a pressure sensor. The
system becomes active when the payload reaches an altitude of 100 meters from AGL. The switch system designed in
order to open includes four leg driven by a stepper motor with specifications of Unipolar NEMA17 200 Step 34x42 mm
1.3A Step Motor-17HS3401. To evaluate habitability, we use humidity, temperature, and VOC (Volatile Organic
Compound) sensor along with a pressure sensor for altitude data. VOC’s are organic compounds with high vapor
pressure at room temperature. Excessive amount of VOC’s can cause serious health problems in humans when inhaled
or absorbed through the skin. The BME680 sensor collects data on pressure, temperature, humidity, and VOC levels.
Although these measurements could be obtained individually by different sensors, BME680 provides a compact
solution with high-resolution readings. These sensor measurements are transmitted live to our custom ground station
using the 433 MHz E32-433T30D LoRa RF module, operating in the 433 MHz band, enabling real-time data monitoring.
Transmission to this band requires a HAM radio license. Additionally, we use the GY-NEO6MV2 GPS module to track the
live position of our payload. To visually document the mission stages, we added a camera and SD card module to the
payload. For this purpose, we selected the ESP32-CAM module as it houses both the OV2640 camera and an SD card
slot. The total weight of our payload is 3.5 Kg. The payload will be inside the rocket until the apogee. It will be
separated from the rocket by the recovery systems that will start at the apogee. The diameter values and fabric of the
payload parachute in the recovery system were calculated and selected to ensure that the payload lands at a speed
that is acceptable for the requirements. 3U cube with dimensions of 100mmx100mmx300mm will be used.
Section 10: Electronics
Electronics Description* Describe all the electronics in your rocket. Include COTS and SRAD components and indicate the role of
each component (primary or backup).
-For altimeters include manufacturer and model. Teams are reminded of the requirement that at least one altimeter must be a
COTS.
-For GPS or telemetry include manufacturer and model, along with whether a HAM license is required.
• Rocket includes three flight computers and one GPS. Two of these systems are COTS, while the other is an SRAD flight
computer. The primary system selected from our COTS devices is the RRC3 Sport Altimeter produced by Missile Works.
This altimeter features a 16MHz 16-bit MSP430 series MCU, 8Mbit SST flash memory, and an MSI NS5697 pressure
sensor. The main reasons for choosing this altimeter are its capability to provide high-resolution pressure data (due to
its 24-bit analog-to-digital converter) and its high availability in our country. The RRC3 Sport Altimeter operates with
dual deployment, allowing it to open both the drogue and main parachutes in our recovery system. The secondary
system utilized is the EasyMini Altimeter produced by Altus Metrum, which is also a COTS device. The EasyMini
Altimeter contains an Arm Cortex M0 MCU, an NXPLCP11U24 chip, an MS5607 pressure sensor, and 1MB of SPI flash
memory. This system operates in dual deployment mode and serves as a backup to the RRC3, providing an additional
layer of safety for the deployment of the drogue and main parachutes. As the third system, an SRAD flight computer
will be used. This SRAD system will not be involved in recovery phases; instead, it will detect the start of flight using
data from its accelerometer and record the rocket's altitude and acceleration data. The PCB to be prepared for our
SRAD system will be designed in the program called Altium Designer and sent to JLCPCB for production. Our team will
handle the assembly of its components. Our COTS systems also record altitude data for the rocket. For GPS, we will use
the Featherweight GPS Tracker produced by Featherweight Altimeters. Since Featherweight GPS operates on the
915MHz band, it does not require an HAM license. This GPS system will provide location tracking for the rocket during
recovery. Each system has independent power sources. The two COTS flight computers and the SRAD system operate
using pairs of serially connected batteries, while our COTS GPS system is powered by a single battery. All batteries are
Li-Ion types packaged in metallic cylindrical enclosures. Batteries will be held in the commercial battery holders. Battery
holders will be placed in a way it prevents acceleration forces to compress springs of battery holders. 22 AWG cables
will be used to connect the necessary components. Paired cables will be in the form of twisted pairs and zip ties will be
used where necessary. There is a Schurter rotary switch between each flight computer, GPS and their power source.
The two COTS altimeters activate the recovery system independently.
Section 11: Recovery
Recovery Description*
Describe your recovery system; dual-deploy, size and style of chute, number of chutes, chute protection method, length of shock
cord(s), and any other components of your recovery system.
Please fill this box out as completely as possible. Identify every independently recovered part of the launch vehicle and its
recovery scheme. As appropriate, identify its associated recovery events, means of event triggering (e.g. barometric,
magnetometer, other...), the redundancy of those event triggers, and the altitude those events should occur at.
• As soon as the assembled rocket is placed on the launch pad, the avionics system that will operate the rescue system is
activated. After the rocket reaches the specified altitude, the avionics system comes into play and performs the
separation process of the rocket. Two avionics components are used in the separation system. One is the RRC3 Sport
Altimeter and the other is the EasyMini Altimeter. These altimeters will be backups of each other and will detect the
apogee and send the first ignition signal. Upon ignition of a pre-measured amount of black powder through these fuses,
the rocket body splits into two sections at the first separation time. At the other separation time, the two altimeters will
continue to work as backups of each other and send the ignition signal for the separation. When the rocket reaches the
required altitude for the second separation, the black powder in the pressurized area ignites upon fuse activation, causing
an explosion and the rocket body splits into three sections. The black powder amount is set at 3 g for the first separation
and 3.4 g for the second separation. Following the first separation, a drogue parachute deploys to control the speed of
the split rocket body, while the main parachute, designated as the payload parachute, ensures the payload (CubeSat)
safely reaches the ground. The payload descends independently from the rocket body and, utilizing the parachute,
achieves a landing speed that is below the specified threshold of 11 m/s (36 ft/s). Simultaneously, the payload is tracked
via a GPS sensor. The separated rocket body sections are connected to with a shock cord. At the altitude specified in the
specifications, 1,500 ft (457 m), the main parachute opens and controls the speed of the rocket. In this way, the rocket
reaches the ground at the required speed. The rocket uses two hot gas generators for the separation stages. Each of the
three parachutes is specially designed according to its load-bearing capacity. Parachutes the number of cords and panels
has been selected: 12 panels on the main parachute and 8 panels on both the primary (drogue) and payload parachutes.
The parachute segments were selected as 12 panels for the main parachute and 8 panels for the primary (drogue) and
payload parachutes. Fireproof protective fabric will be used to protect the parachutes. A shock cord protector will be
used for the shock cords. The parachutes used in the recovery system have a circular geometry with a dome-shaped
design. A circular gap, known as a "vent hole," is in the center of the dome to enhance stability. This vent hole,
approximately 1/10th of the parachute's diameter, controls airflow, preventing excessive drag force that could
compromise stability during descent. The length of each parachute cord is set to 1.75 times the parachute's inflated
diameter. Durable 3 mm-thick polyester cords were chosen. The parachutes are made from Ripstop Nylon 40 D, a material
with low air permeability and high tear resistance. In parachute design, a drag coefficient of 0.8 is assumed. An integral
part of the recovery system shock cord, Perlon Flat licensed with a minimum strength of 15 kN and a weight of 34 grams
was selected. To enhance the rocket and recovery system's safety, the shock cord length is set at three times the rocket
length, measuring 4.5 m from the nose to the upper body, and 5.5 m from the upper to the lower body, totalling 10 m.
The parachute colours are neon orange for the drogue parachute, neon green for the payload parachute, and neon red
for the main parachute. The parachutes will be produced using specially ordered parachute fabric and ropes. Finally, the
parachute diameters are calculated to meet target descent speeds: 1,25 m for the payload parachute, 0,85 m for the
drogue parachute, and 3 m for the main parachute. M8 swivels and carabiners, with a tensile strength of 560 kg and 550
kg respectively, are used at the connection points between the parachute and shock cord. The parts of the main and drag
parachutes connected to the shock cord are connected with a swivel and a carabiner. At the same time, the eyebolt in
the payload is connected to the payload parachute with a swivel. The connecting elements used are made of cast steel.
One end of the shock cord located in the upper body is connected to the nose eyebolt with a carabiner; the other end is
connected to the eyebolt in the avionics capsule with a carabiner. For the shock cord in the lower body one end is
connected to the lower eyebolt of the avionics capsule and the other end is connected to the bulkhead eyebolt, over the
motor located in lower body, with a carabiner. Hence, three swivels, five eyebolts and five carabiners were used.
